## ðŸ’¡ FAQs

### Is it difficult?

The difficulty level is moderate but can feel challenging if youâ€™re not familiar with services like Redshift, Glue, S3, and Athena. The exam requires a deep understanding of these services and their integration in designing optimal ETL workflows and database solutions on AWS.

### Who is this exam for?

This exam isnâ€™t just for Data Engineers. I recommend it to MLOps, Database Engineers, Cloud Engineers, DevOps professionals, and anyone working with data on AWS.

### Should this be your first AWS certification?

Itâ€™s possible to take this as your first AWS certification, especially if youâ€™re a Data Engineer. However, I recommend starting with the **AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate** to build a foundational understanding of AWS services.

### How long does preparation take?

It depends on your level of expertise. For me, it took about 40 hours to review the exam content and complete practice tests. If youâ€™re already working as a Data Engineer with AWS, Iâ€™d recommend focusing on reviewing key concepts and spending most of your time on practice exams.
