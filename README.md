# aws-data-engineer-associate-notes

I Passed the AWS Certified Data Engineer – Associate Exam on November 22nd, 2024, and during my study journey I created the following notes. I hope they are useful to someone :D



💡Is it difficult? 
The difficulty level is moderate but can feel challenging if you’re not familiar with services like Redshift, Glue, S3, and Athena. The exam requires a deep understanding of these services and their integration in designing optimal ETL workflows and database solutions on AWS.



💡Who is this exam for?
This exam isn’t just for Data Engineers. I recommend it to MLOps, Database Engineers, Cloud Engineers, DevOps professionals, and anyone working with data on AWS. 



💡Should this be your first AWS certification?
It’s possible to take this as your first AWS certification, especially if you’re a Data Engineer. However, I recommend starting with the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate to build a foundational understanding of AWS services.



💡 How long does preparation take?
It depends on your level of expertise. For me, it took about 40 hours to review the exam content and complete practice tests. If you’re already working as a Data Engineer with AWS, I’d recommend focusing on reviewing key concepts and spending most of your time on practice exams.



📚 Resources I Used

• Stéphane Maarek and Frank Kane's “AWS DEA-C01 Certification Prep Course with Exercises and a Full-Length Practice Exam” – highly recommended!

• The best practice exams I found were from Jon Bonso and Thomas Hass. The questions are very similar to the real ones and the explanations are extremely detailed. You'll find them on Tutorials Dojo and Udemy.
