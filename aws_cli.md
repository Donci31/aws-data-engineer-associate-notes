# AWS CLI

The **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands directly in your command-line shell. It provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services, making it a powerful tool for managing and automating AWS resources. The AWS CLI is commonly used for scripting and automating repetitive tasks, as well as for managing resources at scale.

- **Open-source**: The AWS CLI is open-source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).
- **Direct API Access**: It interacts directly with AWS services' public APIs, enabling you to perform actions like creating, managing, and deleting resources.
- **Command-Line Alternative**: The AWS CLI is a convenient alternative to the AWS Management Console, especially for those who prefer command-line interfaces or need automation.
- **Automation & Scripting**: You can develop scripts to automate tasks such as launching EC2 instances, managing S3 buckets, or configuring IAM roles.
- **SSH Access**: The AWS CLI also supports SSH functionality for secure remote access to your EC2 instances. It allows you to connect to and manage instances directly from the command line, which is especially useful for instance management or troubleshooting.


Overall, the AWS CLI is a powerful tool for AWS resource management, automation, and monitoring in environments where a GUI might not be ideal.
