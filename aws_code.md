# AWS CodeDeploy

AWS **CodeDeploy** is a fully managed deployment service that automates the deployment of applications to a variety of compute services, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and even on-premises servers. CodeDeploy supports rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and can be integrated with other AWS services like AWS CodePipeline for seamless, automated application delivery.

### Key Features:
- **Supports EC2 & On-Premises Deployments**: CodeDeploy can manage deployments to EC2 instances as well as on-premises servers, making it a flexible solution for hybrid cloud environments.
- **Deployment Strategies**: CodeDeploy supports multiple deployment strategies, including:
  - **Rolling deployments**: Gradual deployment of new application versions to EC2 instances.
  - **Blue/Green deployments**: Shifting traffic between two environments (blue and green) to ensure minimal downtime and rapid rollback capabilities.
- **Integrated with AWS Services**: Easily integrates with services like CodePipeline for CI/CD, and Lambda for serverless deployments.
- **Customizable Deployment**: CodeDeploy allows you to customize deployment scripts (like hooks) to run specific actions at various stages of the deployment process.
  
### Use Cases:
- **Automated Application Deployment**: Ideal for automatically deploying updates to applications on EC2 instances, Lambda, or on-premises systems.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Blue/Green deployments help ensure that your application has no downtime during updates.


# AWS CodeBuild

AWS **CodeBuild** is a fully managed, serverless build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployment-ready packages. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as CodePipeline and CodeDeploy, making it an essential component for building a robust CI/CD pipeline.

### Key Features:
- **Fully Managed and Scalable**: CodeBuild automatically scales to meet your build requirements, without the need to manage infrastructure.
- **Secure and Pay-As-You-Go**: You only pay for the build time you use, and builds are isolated for security.
- **Buildspec File**: CodeBuild uses a `buildspec.yml` file that defines the build commands, environment variables, and runtime environment for your build, allowing for highly customizable build configurations.
- **Integrates with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, and other AWS services to automate the entire build and deployment process.

### Use Cases:
- **Automated Build Process**: Automates compiling source code, running unit tests, and preparing the application for deployment.
- **Customizable Build Environment**: Through `buildspec.yml`, developers can configure the build environment for different resource requirements, such as different compute resources for intensive builds.

# AWS CodeCommit

AWS **CodeCommit** is a fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories. While AWS CodeCommit is still available, it is being gradually phased out, with new customers unable to sign up for the service after July 25, 2024. AWS recommends migrating to a third-party Git solution, such as GitHub.

### Key Features:
- **Git-based Repository**: Provides a secure and scalable Git repository for storing and versioning your source code.
- **Integrated with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS tools like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, making it easy to build a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- **Secure and Private**: CodeCommit ensures that repositories are secure, private, and integrated with IAM for fine-grained access control.
- **Scalable and Highly Available**: As a fully managed service, CodeCommit automatically scales with your usage and ensures high availability.

### Use Cases:
- **Version Control**: Used primarily for storing and versioning code in a private and secure repository.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Works well with AWS CI/CD tools like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate the delivery process.

# AWS CodePipeline

AWS **CodePipeline** is a fully managed service that automates the build, test, and deployment processes in a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. CodePipeline orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline, integrating services like CodeCommit for source control, CodeBuild for building and testing, and CodeDeploy for deployment.

### Key Features:
- **End-to-End Automation**: CodePipeline allows you to automate the entire software delivery process, from source control to deployment.
- **Seamless Integrations**: Easily integrates with other AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, and even third-party services like GitHub.
- **Conditional Execution**: Supports conditional execution of actions, allowing you to customize workflows based on predefined criteria.
- **Fast Delivery and Rapid Updates**: CodePipeline enables rapid application updates and faster time-to-market by automating the workflow.

### Use Cases:
- **Automating CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates the entire pipeline process, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery**: Ensures your code changes are built, tested, and deployed continuously for faster updates and releases.
