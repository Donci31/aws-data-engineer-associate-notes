# AWS Systems Manager

**AWS Systems Manager** is a comprehensive suite of services that simplifies the management of your AWS resources and applications. It helps automate common tasks like patch management, resource management, and operational troubleshooting. With AWS Systems Manager, you can monitor, maintain, and secure your infrastructure in a streamlined way.

One of the most important features of AWS Systems Manager is **Parameter Store**, which is a secure and scalable storage solution for managing configuration data, secrets, and application parameters. Parameter Store is widely used for storing sensitive data such as database credentials, API keys, and other configurations that need to be managed securely.

## Patch Manager

Patch Manager is a feature of AWS Systems Manager that helps you automate the process of patching and maintaining the security compliance of your EC2 instances. It simplifies patch management across your infrastructure by automatically applying patches to your instances based on predefined schedules or on-demand requests.

## Key Features of Parameter Store

1. **Secure Storage for Configurations and Secrets:**
   - Parameter Store provides a centralized place to store and manage application configurations, secrets, and environment variables securely.
   - Sensitive data such as database credentials, API keys, and passwords can be stored with built-in encryption to ensure data confidentiality.

2. **Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS):**
   - Parameter Store allows you to encrypt sensitive parameters using AWS KMS (Key Management Service). This adds an extra layer of security for your configurations and secrets.
   - You can either use the default AWS KMS key or create and manage your own encryption keys.

3. **Version Tracking:**
   - Parameter Store supports versioning of parameters. This enables you to track changes to your configuration data and retrieve older versions of parameters if necessary.

4. **IAM (Identity and Access Management) Security:**
   - You can control access to the stored parameters using AWS IAM policies. This ensures that only authorized users or services can retrieve or modify the parameters, providing fine-grained control over access.
   - Permissions can be set to restrict who can view or modify specific parameters.

5. **Notifications with Amazon EventBridge:**
   - You can set up notifications for changes to parameters through Amazon EventBridge. This allows you to trigger specific actions or workflows when a parameter is updated or modified.
   - EventBridge integration helps you automate tasks in response to configuration changes, such as triggering Lambda functions or notifying administrators of changes to critical parameters.

6. **Integration with AWS CloudFormation:**
   - Parameter Store integrates with AWS CloudFormation, allowing you to use parameters as inputs for CloudFormation stacks. This enables you to manage parameters as part of your infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows.

### Parameter Policies: Advanced Features

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store offers **Parameter Policies**, which provide advanced capabilities for managing parameters:

1. **Time-to-Live (TTL) for Parameters:**
   - Parameter policies allow you to set a TTL (expiration date) on parameters, automatically deleting or requiring an update to sensitive data after a specified period.
   - This is particularly useful for scenarios where passwords or API keys should expire after a certain time to improve security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

2. **Multiple Policies for Parameters:**
   - You can assign multiple policies to a single parameter. For example, you could set a TTL policy alongside encryption or versioning policies, allowing for more complex control over the lifecycle of your parameters.

3. **Automatic Updates or Deletion:**
   - When the TTL for a parameter expires, the policy can automatically trigger an action, such as deleting the parameter or forcing an update.
   - This helps ensure that sensitive information like credentials is regularly updated or removed from the system as needed, enhancing security practices.

### Common Use Cases for Parameter Store:

- **Storing Sensitive Information:** Use Parameter Store to store database passwords, API keys, and other secrets securely. With optional encryption using KMS, you can ensure that sensitive data is protected both at rest and in transit.
  
- **Configuration Management:** Store configuration data for your applications and retrieve it programmatically, making it easier to manage environment-specific settings (e.g., dev, staging, prod) across different AWS resources.

- **Integration with Automation Services:** Leverage Parameter Store to store input parameters for automated workflows, such as those used in AWS Lambda, AWS CodePipeline, or AWS CloudFormation.

- **Secure Application Settings:** Ensure that only authorized services and users can access specific parameters, leveraging IAM roles and policies to control access. You can also track changes to parameters using versioning and auditing features.
