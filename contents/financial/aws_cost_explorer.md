# AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer is a powerful tool designed to give you a detailed and comprehensive view of your AWS costs and usage over time. It helps organizations manage their AWS resources more efficiently by providing insights into spending patterns, usage trends, and cost optimization opportunities. With Cost Explorer, you can visualize, analyze, and manage your AWS spending across different accounts, services, and resources.

## Custom Reporting

AWS Cost Explorer allows you to create custom reports that analyze your cost and usage data in a flexible way. You can drill down to different levels of granularity—such as total costs across all accounts or specific costs by service, region, or resource. This level of customization allows you to focus on the aspects of your usage that matter most, helping you make informed decisions about your AWS spending.

## Cost Optimization

Cost Explorer provides deep visibility into your AWS resource usage at different levels, allowing you to identify opportunities for cost optimization. For instance, you can spot underutilized resources, like idle EC2 instances or oversized instances, and take action to reduce your spending. The ability to analyze cost data at granular levels, such as by service or individual resource, makes it easier to pinpoint areas where resources are being wasted or where efficiencies can be achieved.

## Trend Analysis

AWS Cost Explorer enables you to analyze cost and usage trends over time, with reports available at a **monthly granularity**. This trend analysis allows you to identify fluctuations in usage and spending patterns, helping you better understand your costs and plan budgets more effectively. You can examine your historical usage data over multiple years, which is particularly useful for forecasting future costs and aligning them with your organizational goals.

## Resource-Level Data

Cost Explorer provides detailed data on costs at the **resource level**, allowing you to pinpoint specific AWS resources driving the most significant costs. For example, you can track the spending of individual EC2 instances, identify which ones are the most expensive, and adjust your resource allocation accordingly. This resource-level visibility helps ensure that you’re only paying for the resources you actually need, optimizing your infrastructure and minimizing waste.

## Forecasting Future Usage

One of the most useful features of AWS Cost Explorer is its ability to **forecast usage** up to **12 months** in advance, based on your historical data. By analyzing past usage trends, Cost Explorer can project future usage and estimate future costs, enabling you to plan for upcoming expenses and better allocate your budget. This is particularly helpful for organizations with dynamic and fluctuating workloads, as it allows for proactive cost management.

## Savings Plans

Cost Explorer helps you identify opportunities to purchase **Savings Plans**, which offer significant discounts on your AWS bill in exchange for a commitment to specific usage patterns. By reviewing your cost and usage data, Cost Explorer can help you choose the most appropriate Savings Plan to reduce your overall AWS costs. These plans are a great way to optimize long-term spending and lock in lower rates for predictable workloads.
