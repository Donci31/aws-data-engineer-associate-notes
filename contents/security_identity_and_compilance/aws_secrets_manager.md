# AWS Secrets Manager

AWS Secrets Manager is a fully managed service designed to securely store, manage, and rotate sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and database credentials. It simplifies the management of secrets, enabling applications to retrieve them without storing them in code or environment variables.

## Key Features

1. **Secret Rotation**:
   - Secrets Manager allows you to configure automatic rotation of secrets at specified intervals (e.g., every X days).
   - Rotation is automated using **AWS Lambda**, which can be customized to handle the logic of updating the secret and applying changes wherever needed.

2. **Integration with RDS**:
   - Secrets Manager integrates with Amazon RDS (including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Aurora), making it easy to store and manage database credentials.
   - Database credentials are securely rotated, ensuring that applications always use the most current credentials without needing manual intervention.

3. **Encryption with KMS**:
   - Secrets stored in Secrets Manager are automatically encrypted using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**. This ensures that sensitive data, such as database passwords and API keys, are securely stored and accessible only to authorized users and applications.

4. **Multi-Region Support**:
   - Secrets Manager supports replicating secrets across multiple AWS regions.
   - It keeps **read replicas** of a primary secret in sync across regions.
   - In the case of regional failures or disaster recovery, you can promote a read replica to become a **standalone secret**.
   - This is beneficial for use cases like **multi-region applications**, **disaster recovery strategies**, and multi-region database deployments.

5. **Seamless Integration with Applications**:
   - Applications can access secrets stored in Secrets Manager using the AWS SDK or API calls, eliminating the need to hard-code secrets into applications or store them in environment variables.

6. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Secrets Manager is built with security in mind. It integrates with IAM to manage access permissions and audit the use of secrets with **AWS CloudTrail**.
   - This helps maintain compliance with various security standards, including **HIPAA**, **SOC 2**, and **PCI DSS**.

## Comparison of Secrets Manager and Systems Manager Parameter Store

| Feature                       | AWS Secrets Manager                | AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use Case**           | Secure management of secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) | Storage of configuration data, including non-sensitive values |
| **Automatic Secret Rotation**  | Yes (automated via AWS Lambda)     | No (manual rotation)                   |
| **Encryption**                 | Secrets are encrypted by default using AWS KMS | Parameter values can be encrypted with AWS KMS or stored as plaintext |
| **Integration with RDS**       | Seamless integration for database credentials | No native integration with RDS        |
| **Multi-Region Support**       | Yes (replication and read replicas) | No (only regional)                     |
| **Cost**                       | $0.40 per secret per month + API call charges | Free (basic parameters), additional charges for KMS-encrypted parameters |
| **Use Case Examples**          | Managing database credentials, API keys | Configuration data (e.g., application settings, network settings) |
| **IAM Integration**            | Fine-grained IAM policies for secret access | Fine-grained IAM policies for parameter access |
| **Audit and Logging**          | Integrated with AWS CloudTrail for full audit of secret usage | Integrated with AWS CloudTrail for parameter access audit |
| **Access Methods**             | API, SDK, Lambda, AWS CLI         | API, SDK, Lambda, AWS CLI             |

AWS Secrets Manager is specifically designed to handle sensitive information securely with the ability to automate secret rotation, integrate with Amazon RDS, and replicate secrets across multiple regions for disaster recovery. It provides robust security features, such as encryption with KMS and IAM-based access control.

In contrast, **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** is a more general-purpose service for storing configuration data, which can also handle encrypted parameters but lacks the advanced secret management features (like automatic rotation and multi-region replication) provided by Secrets Manager. Parameter Store is typically used for less-sensitive data or configuration parameters that donâ€™t require frequent rotation.
