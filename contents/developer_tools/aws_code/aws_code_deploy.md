# AWS CodeDeploy

AWS **CodeDeploy** is a fully managed deployment service that automates the deployment of applications to a variety of compute services, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and even on-premises servers. CodeDeploy supports rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and can be integrated with other AWS services like AWS CodePipeline for seamless, automated application delivery.

## Key Features

- **Supports EC2 & On-Premises Deployments**: CodeDeploy can manage deployments to EC2 instances as well as on-premises servers, making it a flexible solution for hybrid cloud environments.
- **Deployment Strategies**: CodeDeploy supports multiple deployment strategies, including:
  - **Rolling deployments**: Gradual deployment of new application versions to EC2 instances.
  - **Blue/Green deployments**: Shifting traffic between two environments (blue and green) to ensure minimal downtime and rapid rollback capabilities.
- **Integrated with AWS Services**: Easily integrates with services like CodePipeline for CI/CD, and Lambda for serverless deployments.
- **Customizable Deployment**: CodeDeploy allows you to customize deployment scripts (like hooks) to run specific actions at various stages of the deployment process.

## Use Cases

- **Automated Application Deployment**: Ideal for automatically deploying updates to applications on EC2 instances, Lambda, or on-premises systems.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Blue/Green deployments help ensure that your application has no downtime during updates.
