# AWS CodeBuild

AWS **CodeBuild** is a fully managed, serverless build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployment-ready packages. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as CodePipeline and CodeDeploy, making it an essential component for building a robust CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Fully Managed and Scalable**: CodeBuild automatically scales to meet your build requirements, without the need to manage infrastructure.
- **Secure and Pay-As-You-Go**: You only pay for the build time you use, and builds are isolated for security.
- **Buildspec File**: CodeBuild uses a `buildspec.yml` file that defines the build commands, environment variables, and runtime environment for your build, allowing for highly customizable build configurations.
- **Integrates with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, and other AWS services to automate the entire build and deployment process.

## Use Cases

- **Automated Build Process**: Automates compiling source code, running unit tests, and preparing the application for deployment.
- **Customizable Build Environment**: Through `buildspec.yml`, developers can configure the build environment for different resource requirements, such as different compute resources for intensive builds.
