# AWS CodePipeline

AWS **CodePipeline** is a fully managed service that automates the build, test, and deployment processes in a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. CodePipeline orchestrates the entire CI/CD pipeline, integrating services like CodeCommit for source control, CodeBuild for building and testing, and CodeDeploy for deployment.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Automation**: CodePipeline allows you to automate the entire software delivery process, from source control to deployment.
- **Seamless Integrations**: Easily integrates with other AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, and even third-party services like GitHub.
- **Conditional Execution**: Supports conditional execution of actions, allowing you to customize workflows based on predefined criteria.
- **Fast Delivery and Rapid Updates**: CodePipeline enables rapid application updates and faster time-to-market by automating the workflow.

## Use Cases

- **Automating CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates the entire pipeline process, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Continuous Integration & Delivery**: Ensures your code changes are built, tested, and deployed continuously for faster updates and releases.
