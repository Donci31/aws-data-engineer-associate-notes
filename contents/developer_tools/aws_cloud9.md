**AWS Cloud9** is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to write, run, and debug code directly from a web browser. It provides a rich set of features, including a code editor, a terminal, and debugging tools, all integrated into a single environment. Cloud9 is particularly useful for developers who need an environment that can be easily accessed from anywhere without the need for complex local setups.

Key Features:

- **Browser-Based IDE**: Access your development environment from any device with an internet connection.
- **Preconfigured with AWS Tools**: AWS Cloud9 comes preconfigured with the AWS SDKs and command-line tools, making it easy to develop applications that interact with AWS services.
- **Collaborative Development**: You can invite team members to work on the same code in real time, which simplifies collaboration on projects.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: AWS Cloud9 supports multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and more.

- **Debugging Tools**: Provides powerful debugging tools, including breakpoints, stack traces, and variable inspection.

**Use Case**:
AWS Cloud9 is particularly useful for cloud-based development, remote teams, or anyone needing to access a development environment without managing local resources. It is also handy for serverless application development, as it integrates easily with other AWS services like AWS Lambda.
