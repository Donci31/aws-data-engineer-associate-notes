# AWS CodeCommit

AWS **CodeCommit** is a fully managed source control service that hosts Git repositories. While AWS CodeCommit is still available, it is being gradually phased out, with new customers unable to sign up for the service after July 25, 2024. AWS recommends migrating to a third-party Git solution, such as GitHub.

## Key Features

- **Git-based Repository**: Provides a secure and scalable Git repository for storing and versioning your source code.
- **Integrated with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS tools like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, making it easy to build a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- **Secure and Private**: CodeCommit ensures that repositories are secure, private, and integrated with IAM for fine-grained access control.
- **Scalable and Highly Available**: As a fully managed service, CodeCommit automatically scales with your usage and ensures high availability.

## Use Cases

- **Version Control**: Used primarily for storing and versioning code in a private and secure repository.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Works well with AWS CI/CD tools like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate the delivery process.
