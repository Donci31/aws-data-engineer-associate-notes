# AWS Backup

AWS Backup is a fully managed, centralized service that simplifies the process of managing, automating, and securing backups across various AWS services. AWS Backup is designed to handle backups for diverse workloads, from databases to file storage, while ensuring compliance with data residency laws and providing multi-account, multi-region backup management capabilities.

## Key Features of AWS Backup

AWS Backup offers a range of features that streamline backup management, provide flexible scheduling, and enhance security. Here’s an overview of its primary features:

- **Centralized Management**: AWS Backup allows for the centralized management of backup policies across multiple AWS services and accounts. This eliminates the need for custom scripts or manual processes and ensures consistency across services.
- **Cross-Region and Cross-Account Backup**: AWS Backup supports backups across different AWS regions and accounts, making it easier to implement geographically distributed backups to enhance disaster recovery and compliance with data residency regulations.
- **Wide Service Coverage**: AWS Backup provides support for several AWS services, ensuring you can centralize all data protection policies for the following resources:
    - **Compute**: Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS
    - **Storage**: Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and AWS Storage Gateway (Volume Gateway)
    - **Databases**: Amazon RDS (including all supported database engines), Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon Neptune
    - **File Systems**: Amazon FSx (both Lustre and Windows File Server)

## Backup Management and Scheduling

AWS Backup provides flexibility in scheduling and managing backups, with options to set backup frequencies, retention policies, and transition times for cold storage. Users can define their backup needs with the following options:

- **Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)**: For services that support PITR, AWS Backup enables restoration to specific points in time, helping to recover lost or corrupted data.
- **On-Demand and Scheduled Backups**: AWS Backup supports both on-demand backups and scheduled backups, making it easier to meet diverse recovery and retention requirements.
- **Tag-Based Backup Policies**: You can define backup policies, or Backup Plans, based on resource tags, enabling automatic backups based on tagging policies across various services and environments.

## Backup Plan Components

Backup Plans in AWS Backup are fully customizable and allow you to specify backup frequency, retention settings, and transition rules. Key elements of a backup plan include:

- **Backup Frequency**: Users can set backup frequency to run as often as every 12 hours, or customize it using daily, weekly, monthly schedules, or even with cron expressions for more complex timing.
- **Backup Window**: Define specific time windows during which backups occur, helping to manage performance and resource usage.
- **Transition to Cold Storage**: AWS Backup offers the option to automatically transition older backups to cost-effective cold storage. You can configure transitions based on periods, such as days, weeks, months, or years, to align with your data archiving policies.
- **Retention Periods**: Customize the length of time backups are retained with options ranging from days to years, or even “always,” ensuring that historical data is kept according to compliance and operational needs.

## AWS Backup Vaults and Security

AWS Backup Vaults serve as secure storage locations for backups, offering the flexibility to configure access control and additional security mechanisms. AWS Backup Vault Lock is a robust feature that enforces a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy, adding an extra layer of data protection:

- **Backup Vaults**: AWS Backup Vaults allow you to organize and store backups securely with fine-grained access control and tagging.
- **Backup Vault Lock**: This feature enables you to configure a WORM state for all backups stored in a Backup Vault, preventing accidental or malicious deletions, and ensuring backup retention periods remain unaltered.
    - **Prevents Inadvertent or Malicious Deletion**: Once Backup Vault Lock is enabled, even AWS account root users are restricted from deleting or modifying retention settings, adding an additional layer of security to your backups.
    - **Retention Integrity**: Backup Vault Lock helps protect the retention policies set in backup plans, preventing any changes that could compromise the integrity of your data retention.

## Compliance and Resilience

AWS Backup provides a framework to ensure that your organization’s data protection policies meet regulatory compliance requirements and internal data protection standards. By supporting multi-region and multi-account configurations, AWS Backup aligns with disaster recovery best practices and enables:

- **Compliance with Data Residency Laws**: With the ability to specify regions for backup storage, AWS Backup allows organizations to comply with data residency laws by ensuring backups remain within required geographic locations.
- **Simplified Multi-Account Management**: AWS Backup’s multi-account backup capability helps organizations with complex AWS setups to maintain centralized control over backup operations, ensuring consistency and compliance across accounts.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region and cross-account backups help organizations enhance their disaster recovery capabilities by ensuring that backups are accessible even in the event of a regional or account-specific outage.
