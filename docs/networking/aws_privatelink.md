# AWS PrivateLink

**AWS PrivateLink** enables private, secure communication between your **VPC** and supported AWS services, third-party services, or your own services across different VPCs—without using the public internet. With PrivateLink, traffic flows entirely within the **AWS network**, avoiding exposure to the internet, making it more secure.

AWS PrivateLink uses **interface endpoints** to establish connections to services. These interface endpoints are **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** that provide a private IP address for the service you're connecting to, whether it's an AWS service or a service hosted in another VPC.

## How AWS PrivateLink Works

- **Service Provider VPC**: The VPC that hosts the service you want to share. The service is exposed via a **network load balancer (NLB)** or **AWS service endpoint**.

- **Service Consumer VPC**: The VPC that will consume the service exposed via PrivateLink. To access the service, it creates an **interface endpoint** that connects to the service provider’s NLB or service endpoint.

The key difference here is that **PrivateLink** doesn’t involve any type of site-to-site VPN connection or even dedicated physical connections like AWS Direct Connect. Instead, it focuses on **privately accessing services** over a network interface with **no exposure to the public internet**.

## PrivateLink vs. Site-to-Site VPN & Direct Connect

- **Site-to-Site VPN** and **AWS Direct Connect** are primarily used for connecting **entire networks** (on-premises environments or different VPCs) to your AWS infrastructure.

- **AWS PrivateLink**, on the other hand, is focused on securely accessing specific services within AWS. You typically use PrivateLink when you want to connect to AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) or your own services hosted in a different VPC securely over a private network, without exposing traffic to the public internet.

| Feature                        | **Site-to-Site VPN**                           | **AWS Direct Connect**                        | **AWS PrivateLink**                           |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                    | Connect on-premises networks to AWS            | Establish private, dedicated connections from on-premises to AWS | Securely connect to AWS services or services hosted in other VPCs within AWS |
| **Connection Type**            | VPN connection over the internet               | Dedicated, private connection               | Private connection over the AWS network (no internet exposure) |
| **Use Case**                   | On-premises to AWS VPC network connectivity    | Dedicated, high-performance AWS network connection | Service-to-service or service-to-VPC secure communication |
| **Encryption**                 | IPsec encryption by default                    | No encryption; must use IPsec or other options | Traffic is automatically encrypted within the AWS network |
| **Cost**                       | Lower cost (uses public internet)              | Higher cost (dedicated network)             | Pay-as-you-go based on endpoints and data transfer |
| **Latency and Throughput**     | Varies based on internet conditions            | Low latency, high throughput                | Low latency, optimal for service-to-service communications |
| **Configuration Complexity**   | Easy, quick setup                              | Requires setup time and higher investment    | Simplified configuration, no physical infrastructure needed |

## PrivateLink Use Cases

- **Service Access Across VPCs**: PrivateLink enables you to securely access services across VPCs. For example, if you have a service in one VPC and want another VPC to access it privately, PrivateLink can enable that communication without using public IP addresses or exposing the service to the internet.

- **Accessing AWS Services Privately**: If you want to access AWS services like **S3** or **DynamoDB** securely from your VPC, you can set up PrivateLink to avoid the need for an internet gateway.

- **Third-Party Service Integration**: Many third-party service providers host their services through **AWS PrivateLink**, making it easy to connect to their services securely without leaving the AWS network.
