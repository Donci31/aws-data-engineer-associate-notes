# Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)

Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a **fully-managed orchestration service** that simplifies running and scaling data pipelines in the cloud using **Apache Airflow**. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used for **authoring, scheduling, and monitoring** workflows, which are sequences of processes and tasks that can be linked together in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

With **Amazon MWAA**, you can leverage the power of Apache Airflow and Python to automate and manage workflows at scale, without needing to handle the underlying infrastructure. Amazon MWAA **automatically scales** its workflow execution capacity, enabling efficient and dynamic scaling based on your needs, while also ensuring high availability and security.

## Apache Airflow Overview

- **Batch-Oriented Workflow Tool**:
  - Apache Airflow is designed for batch-oriented processing, where workflows consist of tasks executed on a scheduled or triggered basis.

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**:
  - Workflows are defined using **Python code**, which creates a **DAG**. Each task in the workflow is a node in the graph, and edges define task dependencies.

- **Custom Logic**:
  - Airflow enables the development of **custom operators** and **scripts**, allowing you to integrate a wide variety of data sources and processing logic.

- **Extensive Plugin Library**:
  - Apache Airflow has a broad ecosystem of plugins, including **operators**, **hooks**, and **executors**, making it highly extensible.

## Fully Managed Service

- **Managed Environment**:
  - **Amazon MWAA** fully manages Apache Airflow's infrastructure. You don't need to handle the installation, scaling, or maintenance of Apache Airflow itself, saving time and effort.

- **Automatic Scaling**:
  - MWAA supports **auto-scaling** of **Airflow workers**, ensuring that the service dynamically adjusts the number of workers based on factors such as:
    - The number of tasks in the queue.
    - The average task run time.
  - This scaling occurs automatically, without the need for manual intervention.

- **Secure and Fast Data Access**:
  - **AWS security services** integrate seamlessly with Amazon MWAA, providing fast, secure access to your data, and ensuring that your workflows operate within a compliant and protected environment.

## Connecting to Remote Systems with SSH

- **SSHOperator**:
  - Amazon MWAA supports the **SSHOperator**, which allows workflows in Apache Airflow to connect to **remote Amazon EC2 instances** or other systems with SSH access.

- **Setup Process**:
  1. **Upload SSH Secret Key**: You must first upload an SSH secret key (`.pem`) to your environment's **DAGs directory** in **Amazon S3**.
  2. **Install Dependencies**: Use a `requirements.txt` file to specify necessary Python packages. For SSH access, you need to install the `apache-airflow-providers-ssh` package:

     ```text
     -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-Airflow-version/constraints-Python-version.txt apache-airflow-providers-ssh
     ```

  3. **Create Airflow Connection**: In the Airflow UI, create a new **SSH connection** that points to the target remote instance.
  4. **Write a DAG**: Once the dependencies are installed and the SSH connection is configured, write a DAG that connects to the remote instance via SSH and executes tasks on that instance.

## Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow

- **Python Code for DAGs**:
  - Workflows are defined as **Python code** in the form of **DAGs**. These DAGs describe tasks and their dependencies, allowing you to orchestrate complex workflows.

- **Storage in S3**:
  - Your **DAGs** (Python scripts) and associated files are stored in **Amazon S3**.
  - Amazon MWAA picks up these DAGs and manages their execution on the specified schedule.

- **Execution within VPC**:
  - MWAA runs within a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**, providing isolation and secure network access.
  - You can choose to use **private** or **public endpoints** for accessing the Airflow Web UI or interacting with your workflows.

- **Task Scheduling and Monitoring**:
  - MWAA automatically schedules and executes tasks in the DAG. You can monitor the progress and logs of these tasks using the **Airflow Web UI**.

## Integration with AWS Services

Amazon MWAA integrates with a broad range of AWS services to facilitate seamless data workflows. Some examples include:

- **Data Storage & Processing**:
  - **Amazon S3** for storage of data and DAGs.
  - **Amazon Redshift**, **Amazon DynamoDB**, and **Amazon Athena** for managing and analyzing data.
  - **AWS Glue** for ETL and data integration tasks.

- **Machine Learning & Data Science**:
  - **Amazon SageMaker** for training and deploying machine learning models.
  - **AWS Batch** for executing large-scale batch processing jobs.

- **Compute & Containers**:
  - **Amazon EMR**, **AWS Fargate**, **Amazon EKS**, and **AWS Lambda** can be integrated for compute-heavy tasks and containerized executions.

- **Event-Driven Services**:
  - **Amazon Kinesis** for real-time data streaming.
  - **Amazon SQS** and **Amazon SNS** for queuing and messaging.

## Security and Compliance

- **IAM Integration**:
  - Workflows can be controlled and accessed using **IAM roles** to enforce strict access control and permissions.

- **Secrets Management**:
  - **AWS Secrets Manager** is integrated with MWAA to securely manage sensitive data, like API keys or credentials, used in workflows.

- **Encryption**:
  - Data can be encrypted both **in transit** and **at rest** to meet security requirements.

## Airflow Web UI

- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Airflow provides a rich **Web UI** for monitoring DAGs and visualizing task execution.
  - The **UI** allows you to track progress, view logs, and gain insights into the operational state of your workflows.

- **Task Management**:
  - Users can pause, trigger, or rerun tasks as needed directly from the **Web UI**.

- **Rich UI Features**:
  - Visualize task dependencies and execution flow.
  - View detailed logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Use Cases

Amazon MWAA is particularly well-suited for complex workflows, including:

1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Coordination**:
   - Automate data movement and transformation between various data sources, processing engines, and destinations (e.g., Amazon Redshift, S3, DynamoDB).

2. **Machine Learning Data Pipelines**:
   - Automate the collection, cleaning, and transformation of data for machine learning models.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Automate batch processing workflows, such as large-scale data transformation, cleansing, and analysis.

4. **Event-Driven Orchestration**:
   - Integrate with **AWS Lambda**, **SQS**, or other services for workflows that react to events, such as file uploads or data changes.
